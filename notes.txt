ToDo:   
    Implement default volume
    Timeout for volume screen - return to channel?
    Shorter static sound - no hard stop when the sound is playing?

Requirements:
    -Install mdp
    -set the i2c bus speed to 1mhz
    -modify the /etc/mdp.conf file: 
        uncomment this line:
            bind_to_address         "/run/mpd/socket"
        comment out this line:
            bind_to_address     "localhost:

        modify these two lines from:
            music_directory     "/var/lib/mpd/music"
            playlist_directory  "/var/lib/mpd/playlists"
        to:
            music_directory     "/home/pi/piradio/audio/music"
            playlist_directory  "/home/pi/piradio/audio/playlists"

        Review this to determine proper audio_output settings:

        This works for me on my Pi:
        audio_output {
                type            "alsa"
                name            "ALSA Onboard Audio"
                device          "hw:CARD=Headphones,DEV=0"
                mixer_type      "hardware"
                mixer_device    "default"
                mixer_control   "Headphone"
                mixer_index     "0"
        }

Notes:
    MPD config file:  
        /etc/mpd.conf
    Restart MPD:  
        sudo systemctl restart mpd
    Get version (and other info)
        mpd --version
