PiFi Radio https://github.com/rccavalcanti/pifi-radio
    Pros: Super clean, simple web UI.
    Cons: No song info, no graphics for stations

    Uses JSON for station list.  I can work with this.


modify the /etc/mdp.conf file: 
    uncomment this line:
        bind_to_address         "/run/mpd/socket"
    comment out this line:
        bind_to_address     "localhost:

    modify these two lines from:
        music_directory     "/var/lib/mpd/music"
        playlist_directory  "/var/lib/mpd/playlists"
    to:
        music_directory     "/home/pi/piradio/audio/music"
        playlist_directory  "/home/pi/piradio/audio/playlists"

    Review this to determine proper audio_output settings:

    This works for me on my Pi:
    audio_output {
            type            "alsa"
            name            "ALSA Onboard Audio"
            device          "hw:CARD=Headphones,DEV=0"
            mixer_type      "hardware"
            mixer_device    "default"
            mixer_control   "Headphone"
            mixer_index     "0"
    }
